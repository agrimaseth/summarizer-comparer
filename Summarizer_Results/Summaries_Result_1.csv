Macarena Garcia’s career in public health had a bit of an unlikely start: capitalizing on her ability to type nearly as fast as many people talk.

Now she boasts a doctorate degree in public health, is trained in data analytics, and has managed teams of senior public health technical advisers across much of sub-Saharan Africa. She has spent four years advising governments on how to effectively implement Global Fund grants, and five more years as a senior health scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And she is now leading CDC’s COVID-19 work in the Dominican Republic.

But she might have accomplished none of that had it not been for the fact that she types 90 words per minute.

“That simple skill is what changed the direction of my life,” she says.

Born in 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Macarena moved with her family to Los Angeles when she was a child. She got her undergraduate degree in political science in 1999 and planned to enter a dual-degree master’s program in law and international public affairs that fall, but fate intervened.

“That summer, a friend of mine called me up and said, ‘Hey, I have a job for a transcriber, and I know you type really fast.’ ”

The job was an eight-week gig transcribing interviews for producers of the television series, “Survivor,” which was being shot in Kenya’s Shaba National Reserve, a short flight from Nairobi. Though the physical challenges endured by the contestants were real, Macarena found the overall experience–which involved condensing three days of shooting into each 30-minute episode—more boring than dramatic. But she found real drama during a break from the TV work when she toured a nearby mission hospital.

“Every single person was wasting away from HIV,” Macarena says. “I thought, ‘This is the biggest problem on this continent, and I want to do something about it.’ ”

She put her master’s program on hold and volunteered to work instead with an HIV program in Botswana. After a year, she decided to return to graduate school to study public health.

In 2004, after getting her master’s in international studies and public health at the University of Sydney, Macarena got her first job as a development worker, managing an HIV program with Catholic Relief Services in Nigeria. It proved to be a good fit.

“I really sort of fell in love with the work and the effect that work could have,” she says. Similar work followed in Vietnam, Lesotho, Kenya, South Africa, “and some other places.”

Eventually, she got her doctorate from Flinders University in South Australia. And in 2015, Macarena joined CDC in Atlanta as a senior health scientist. Her work focused on responses to emergencies, including the 2015 Zika virus outbreak, the 2017/2018 hurricanes, and the 2019 e-cigarette and vaping-associated lung Injury outbreak, which prepared her for her current work in the Dominican Republic.

Last July, the Caribbean nation of nearly 11 million people was reporting about 1,500 new COVID-19 cases a day, and Macarena was tapped to guide CDC’s response. With nearly a third of the country living in poverty, any efforts to combat the pandemic needed to be low-cost.

Luckily, the Dominican Republic proved to be resource-rich when it comes to public health. It offers universal health care, and over the years, CDC has trained nearly 600 Dominican epidemiologists.

Over the course of the outbreak, the Dominican Republic has declared states of emergency three times to limit the spread of the disease. The most recent emergency declaration established a 5 p.m. curfew, after which no one was allowed outside without a pass. On weekends and holidays, the curfew began at noon. Pharmacies, supermarkets, and restaurants delivered.

In December, Macarena, her partner, and their 11-year-old daughter moved full-time to the Dominican Republic. As CDC country director, Macarena is responsible for all CDC activities in the country, including HIV prevention, care, and treatment; emergency preparedness and response; laboratory capacity and, of course, COVID-19.

Macarena has advised the Dominican Republic’s president and his health cabinet on travel orders, and she engages with the Vice President’s Office on Vaccine Supplies and implementation of the country’s vaccination program.

Since her arrival, rates of COVID-19 cases have remained stable at about 520 per day, for which Macarena credits the host of government prevention steps that have been implemented. “I am but a tiny cog in the machine,” she says.

Meanwhile, Macarena is adding to her skill set – she has enrolled in another master’s degree program, this time in data science and analytics, and is a part-time professor of research methods and biostatistics at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology, which has a department of public health. Her work and studies are keeping her busy and her typing skills sharp.",cdcs macarena garcia compares covid case trend data with the timing of government prevention steps photo by meena celeste garcia macarena garcias career in public health had a bit of an unlikely start capitalizing on her ability to type nearly as fast as many people talk now she boasts a doctorate degree in public health is trained in data analytics and has managed teams of senior public health technical advisers across much of sub saharan africa she has spent four years advising governments on how to effectively implement global fund grants and five more years as a senior health scientist at the centers for disease control and prevention and she is now leading cdcs covid work in the dominican republic but she might have accomplished none of that had it not been for the fact that she types words per minute that simple skill is what changed the direction of my life she says born in in buenos aires argentina macarena moved with her family to los angeles when she was a child she got her undergraduate degree in political science in and planned to enter a dual degree masters program in law and international public affairs that fall but fate intervened that summer a friend of mine called me up and said hey i have a job for a transcriber and i know you type really fast the job was an eight week gig transcribing interviews for producers of the television series survivor which was being shot in kenyas shaba national reserve a short flight from nairobi though the physical challenges endured by the contestants were real macarena found the overall experiencewhich involved condensing three days of shooting into each minute episodemore boring than dramatic but she found real drama during a break from the tv work when she toured a nearby mission hospital every single person was wasting away from hiv macarena says i thought this is the biggest problem on this continent and i want to do something about it she put her masters program on hold and volunteered to work instead with an hiv program in botswana after a year she decided to return to graduate school to study public health in after getting her masters in international studies and public health at the university of sydney macarena got her first job as a development worker managing an hiv program with catholic relief services in nigeria it proved to be a good fit i really sort of fell in love with the work and the effect that work could have she says similar work followed in vietnam lesotho kenya south africa and some other places eventually she got her doctorate from flinders university in south australia and in macarena joined cdc in atlanta as a senior health scientist her work focused on responses to emergencies including the zika virus outbreak the 2018 hurricanes and the e cigarette and vaping associated lung injury outbreak which prepared her for her current work in the dominican republic last july the caribbean nation of nearly million people was reporting about 500 new covid cases a day and macarena was tapped to guide cdcs response with nearly a third of the country living in poverty any efforts to combat the pandemic needed to be low cost luckily the dominican republic proved to be resource rich when it comes to public health it offers universal health care and over the years cdc has trained nearly dominican epidemiologists over the course of the outbreak the dominican republic has declared states of emergency three times to limit the spread of the disease the most recent emergency declaration established a p m curfew after which no one was allowed outside without a pass on weekends and holidays the curfew began at noon pharmacies supermarkets and restaurants delivered in december macarena her partner and their year old daughter moved full time to the dominican republic as cdc country director macarena is responsible for all cdc activities in the country including hiv prevention care and treatment emergency preparedness and response laboratory capacity and of course covid macarena has advised the dominican republics president and his health cabinet on travel orders and she engages with the vice presidents office on vaccine supplies and implementation of the countrys vaccination program since her arrival rates of covid cases have remained stable at about per day for which macarena credits the host of government prevention steps that have been implemented i am but a tiny cog in the machine she says meanwhile macarena is adding to her skill set she has enrolled in another masters degree program this time in data science and analytics and is a part time professor of research methods and biostatistics at the chicago school of professional psychology which has a department of public health her work and studies are keeping her busy and her typing skills sharp

Impact of sickle cell trait on morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection who identified as black or African American were included in the study (n = 166). Blood remnants were tested for SCT, and clinical data were abstracted from the chart. There was no difference in mortality between those with SCT and those without. There was no difference in respiratory complications between groups, but those without SCT had a much higher burden of chronic lung disease (P = .004). Those with SCT had higher creatinine on admission (P = .004), but no difference in in-hospital renal complications (P = .532).

Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding the relevance of smoking on risk of COVID-19 and its severity. We undertook large-scale observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses using UK Biobank. Genetically predicted higher number of cigarettes smoked per day was associated with higher risks of all outcomes (infection OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.24; hospitalization OR 5.08, 95% CI 2.04 to 12.66; and death OR 10.02, 95% CI 2.53 to 39.72). Congruent results from two analytical approaches support a causal effect of smoking on risk of severe COVID-19.

We applied molecular portrayal using self-organizing maps machine learning (SOM portrayal) to characterize the diversity of the virus genomes, their mutual relatedness and development since the beginning of the pandemic. The genetic landscape obtained visualizes the relevant mutations in a lineage-specific fashion and provides developmental paths in genetic state space from early lineages towards the variants of concern alpha, beta, gamma and delta

The dramatic change in vaccine effectiveness from June to July is likely to be due to both the emergence of the delta variant and waning immunity over time, compounded by the end of masking requirements in California and the resulting greater risk of exposure in the community.

e performed a head-to-head comparison of the ability of sera from individuals vaccinated with either one of four vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, AZD1222 or Ad26.COV2.S) to recognize and neutralize the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs; Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta). Four weeks after completing the vaccination series, SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralizing antibody titers were highest in recipients of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 (median titers of 1891 and 3061, respectively), and substantially lower in those vaccinated with the adenovirus vector-based vaccines AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S (median titers of 241 and 119, respectively). VOCs neutralization was reduced in all vaccine groups, with the largest (5.8-fold) reduction in neutralization being observed against the Beta variant. Overall, the mRNA vaccines appear superior to adenovirus vector-based vaccines in inducing neutralizing antibodies against VOCs four weeks after the final vaccination.

We found no significant difference in cycle threshold values between vaccinated and unvaccinated, asymptomatic and symptomatic groups infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta. Given the substantial proportion of asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases with high viral levels, interventions, including masking and testing, should be considered for all in settings with elevated COVID-19 transmission.

We developed the SIRDV-Virulence epidemiological model based on a population balance equation to study the effect of mutants of the virus and the effect of vaccination strategies on mitigating the transmission among the population in the United States. Based on the available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we obtain the key parameters governing the dynamic evolution of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Israel, the BNT162b2 vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was approved for use in adolescents in June 2021, shortly before an outbreak of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant-dominant infection. We evaluated short-term vaccine effectiveness and found the vaccine to be highly effective among this population in this setting.

We analyzed 1,036,030 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 30,806 NGS datasets from GISAID and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 2.5% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.6% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 5,472 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only 21 and 14 recurrent variants were found in at least 1% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples.

To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that OAS1, through RNase L, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2. We show that a common splice-acceptor SNP (Rs10774671) governs whether people express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, or only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, in hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.

In this translational study, we discover key variabilities in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, essential SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, among the mucosal tissues of the human proximal airways. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is present in all examined head & neck tissues, with a notable tropism for the nasal cavity and tracheal mucosa. Finally, we uncover an association between smoking and higher SARS-CoV-2 viral infection in the human proximal airway, which may explain the increased susceptibility of smokers to developing severe COVID-19.

We developed a mathematical model that considers both subpopulations and immunity parameters including vaccination rates, vaccine effectiveness, and a gradual loss of protection. The model forecasted the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in the US under varied transmission and vaccination rates. We further obtained the control reproduction number and conducted sensitivity analyses to determine how each parameter may affect virus transmission. Our results show that a combination of strengthening vaccine-induced immunity and preventative behavioral measures will likely be required to deaccelerate the rise of infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants.

853 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generated, representing ~58% of the 1,449 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases detected in Humboldt County as of March 12, 2021. Phylogenetic analysis of these data was used to develop a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 introductions to the county and to support contact tracing and epidemiologic investigations of all large outbreaks in the county. In the case of an outbreak on a commercial farm, viral genomic data were used to validate reported epidemiologic links and link additional cases within the community who did not report a farm exposure to the outbreak.

Nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections have severely affected bed capacity and patient flow. We utilised whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify outbreaks and focus infection control resources and intervention during the UK's second pandemic wave in late 2020. Phylogenetic analysis of WGS and epidemiological data pinpointed an initial transmission event to an admission ward, with immediate prior community infection linkage documented. High incidence of asymptomatic staff infection with genetically identical viral sequences was also observed, which may have contributed to the propagation of the outbreak. WGS allowed timely nosocomial transmission intervention measures, including admissions ward point of care testing and introduction of portable HEPA14 filters.

The following protocol describes our workflow for processing wastewater with the goal of detecting the genetic signal of SARS-CoV-2. The steps include pasteurization, virus concentration, RNA extraction, and quantification by RT-qPCR. We include auxiliary steps that provide new users with tools and strategies that will help troubleshoot key steps in the process. This protocol is one of the safest, cheapest, and most reproducible approaches for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater.

In fall 2020, a coronavirus disease cluster comprising 16 cases occurred in Connecticut, USA. Epidemiologic and genomic evidence supported transmission among persons at a school and fitness center but not a workplace. The multiple transmission chains identified within this cluster highlight the necessity of a combined investigatory approach

Updates as of June 16, 2021 Clarified the differences between laboratory-based and point-of-care NAATs

A Nucleic Acid Amplification Test, or NAAT, is a type of viral diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. NAATs detect genetic material (nucleic acids). NAATs for SARS-CoV-2 specifically identify the RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequences that comprise the genetic material of the virus.

NAATs for SARS-CoV-2 test specimens from either the upper or lower respiratory tract. The type of specimen collected when testing for SARS-CoV-2 is based on the test being performed and the manufacturer’s instructions. See CDC’s Collecting and Handling of Clinical Specimens for COVID-19 Testing.

The NAAT procedure works by first amplifying – or making many copies of – the virus’s genetic material, if any is present in a person’s specimen. Amplifying those nucleic acids enables NAATs to detect very small amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a specimen, making these tests highly sensitive for diagnosing COVID-19. In other words, NAATs can reliably detect small amounts of SARS-CoV-2 and are unlikely to return a false-negative result of SARS-CoV-2.

NAATs can use many different methods to amplify nucleic acids and detect the virus, including but not limited to:

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

Isothermal amplification including: Nicking endonuclease amplification reaction (NEAR) Transcription mediated amplification (TMA) Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Strand displacement amplification (SDA)



Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, both the number and types (methods and technologiesexternal icon) of NAATs authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 have increased. The FDA will likely authorize additional NAAT methods in the future.

NAATs have been authorized for use in different settings, such as in laboratory facilities by trained personnel (laboratory-based) or in point-of-care (POC) settings. Some NAATs can even be self-administered at home or in other non-healthcare locations. Some NAATs are considered rapid tests that are performed at or near the place where the specimen is collected and can provide the result within minutes, whereas the time to complete laboratory-based NAATs ranges from less than an hour to more than a day. The level of sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in a specimen also varies depending on the methods and application of the NAAT. Sensitivity varies by test, but laboratory-based NAATs generally have higher sensitivity than POC tests or self-administered tests.

Because laboratory-based NAATs are considered the most sensitive tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2, they can also be used to confirm the results of lower sensitivity tests, such as POC NAATs or antigen tests.

If POC NAATs do not deliver presumptive results, they can be used for confirmatory testing. If the testing environment does not have the resources or the ability to access laboratory-based NAATs, POC NAATs can also be used for confirmatory testing. Saliva is an acceptable specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing, and some NAATs have been authorized for use with saliva specimens that provide definitive diagnostic and screening results. However, saliva specimen quality can be highly variable, which can affect the performance of the test. CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper respiratory specimen, such as nasopharyngeal, nasal mid-turbinate, or anterior nasal, when using NAATs for confirmatory testing. In cases of discordant test results from different types of tests, results from laboratory-based NAATs should be prioritized over any POC or self-administered test.

If a person receives two or more discordant laboratory-based NAAT results within a 48-hour period, the person should contact a healthcare provider or the local or state health department for test interpretation and clinical guidance on what steps to take.",summary of recent changes updates as of june clarified the differences between laboratory based and point of care naats a nucleic acid amplification test or naat is a type of viral diagnostic test for sars cov the virus that causes covid naats detect genetic material nucleic acids naats for sars cov specifically identify the rna ribonucleic acid sequences that comprise the genetic material of the virus naats for sars cov test specimens from either the upper or lower respiratory tract the type of specimen collected when testing for sars cov is based on the test being performed and the manufacturers instructions see cdcs collecting and handling of clinical specimens for covid testing the naat procedure works by first amplifying or making many copies of the viruss genetic material if any is present in a persons specimen amplifying those nucleic acids enables naats to detect very small amounts of sars cov rna in a specimen making these tests highly sensitive for diagnosing covid in other words naats can reliably detect small amounts of sars cov and are unlikely to return a false negative result of sars cov naats can use many different methods to amplify nucleic acids and detect the virus including but not limited to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr isothermal amplification including nicking endonuclease amplification reaction near transcription mediated amplification tma loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp helicase dependent amplification hda clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr strand displacement amplification sda since the beginning of the covid pandemic both the number and types methods and technologiesexternal icon of naats authorized for emergency use by the u s food and drug administration fda for the detection of sars cov have increased the fda will likely authorize additional naat methods in the future naats have been authorized for use in different settings such as in laboratory facilities by trained personnel laboratory based or in point of care poc settings some naats can even be self administered at home or in other non healthcare locations some naats are considered rapid tests that are performed at or near the place where the specimen is collected and can provide the result within minutes whereas the time to complete laboratory based naats ranges from less than an hour to more than a day the level of sensitivity for the detection of sars cov genetic material in a specimen also varies depending on the methods and application of the naat sensitivity varies by test but laboratory based naats generally have higher sensitivity than poc tests or self administered tests because laboratory based naats are considered the most sensitive tests for detecting sars cov they can also be used to confirm the results of lower sensitivity tests such as poc naats or antigen tests if poc naats do not deliver presumptive results they can be used for confirmatory testing if the testing environment does not have the resources or the ability to access laboratory based naats poc naats can also be used for confirmatory testing saliva is an acceptable specimen type for sars cov testing and some naats have been authorized for use with saliva specimens that provide definitive diagnostic and screening results however saliva specimen quality can be highly variable which can affect the performance of the test cdc recommends collecting and testing an upper respiratory specimen such as nasopharyngeal nasal mid turbinate or anterior nasal when using naats for confirmatory testing in cases of discordant test results from different types of tests results from laboratory based naats should be prioritized over any poc or self administered test if a person receives two or more discordant laboratory based naat results within a hour period the person should contact a healthcare provider or the local or state health department for test interpretation and clinical guidance on what steps to take

Note: If your COVID-19 test is positive, tell a healthcare provider about your positive result and stay in contact with them during your illness. To avoid spreading the virus to others, follow CDC’s guidance for isolation. As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home or place of residence. Tell your close contacts that they may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Testing is critically important to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. If you have symptoms or have had a known exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, you should be tested regardless of your vaccination status. Quarantine if you have been in close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with someone who has COVID-19, unless you have been fully vaccinated.

People who are fully vaccinated do NOT need to quarantine after contact with someone who had COVID-19 unless they have symptoms. Although the risk that fully vaccinated people could become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 is low, any fully vaccinated person who experiences symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from others, be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, and tested for SARS-CoV-2 if indicated. Get tested 3-5 days following a known exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and wear a mask in public indoor settings for 14 days after exposure or until a negative test result.

Fully vaccinated individuals should follow CDC’s recommendations for testing.

If you need to be tested for COVID-19 and can’t get tested by a healthcare provider, you can consider using either a self-collection kit or a self-test that can be performed at home or anywhere else. Sometimes a self-test is also called a “home test” or an “at-home test.” FDAexternal icon provides information on which self-tests are authorized for use.

These self-collection kits and tests are available either by prescription or over the counter, without a prescription, in a pharmacy or retail store. At present, self-collection kits and tests are used for the detection of current infection.

Read the complete manufacturer’s instructions before using the test. Talk to a healthcare provider if you have questions about the test or your results.

Types of Specimens

Some tests require a nasal specimen that can be collected using an anterior nasal swab or a nasal mid-turbinate swab (see the Print Resources section below).

that can be collected using an anterior nasal swab or a nasal mid-turbinate swab (see the Print Resources section below). Other tests require a saliva specimen.

Prepare to Collect a Specimen

Wash your hands with soap.

Open the box and follow the manufacturer’s instructions included with the specimen collection or test kit to collect your own nasal or saliva specimen.

If you don’t collect the specimens as directed, your test results may be incorrect.

Once collected, send the specimen to a testing facility or use the specimen, as described in the manufacturer’s instructions, to complete the self-test.

Performing the Test

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions exactly and perform the steps in the order that they are listed. The manufacturer may also provide other resources, such as quick reference guides or instructional videos, to help you perform the test correctly.

Tips

Store all test components according to the manufacturer’s instructions until ready for use.

Check the expiration date. Don’t use expired tests or test components that are damaged or appear discolored based on the manufacturer’s instructions.

Clean the countertop, table, or other surfaces where you will do the test.

Don’t open test devices or other test components until you are ready to start the testing process.

Read and record test results only within the amount of time specified in the manufacturer’s instructions. A result read before or after the specified timeframe may be incorrect.

Don’t reuse test devices or other components.

After you have the results, discard the specimen collection swab and test kit in the trash, clean all surfaces that the specimen may have touched, and wash your hands.

Reporting Results

Give your results to your healthcare provider or, if you do not have a healthcare provider, to your local or state health department.

et al. The REMAP-CAP (randomized embedded multifactorial adaptive platform for community-acquired pneumonia) study. Rationale and design. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, researchers continue to search for effective treatments. The often unpredictable disease course of COVID-19 creates a substantial challenge for clinical researchers when identifying ideal patient populations who might benefit from investigational interventions. One of the first promising therapeutics considered was convalescent plasma. Several retrospective observational studies in 2020 suggested a beneficial role of convalescent plasma for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19.Following these initial reports, a series of peer-reviewed randomised trials did not confirm the positive findings.The absence of efficacy of convalescent plasma is now reinforced by the results from the RECOVERY Collaborative Group,published in The Lancet, in which 5795 patients received convalescent plasma plus usual care and 5763 received usual care alone in a randomised, open-label study done in 177 National Health Service hospital organisations in the UK. Of the 11 558 randomly assigned patients, 4128 (36%) were women and the mean age was 63·5 (SD 14·7) years. Halted prematurely by an independent data monitoring committee, no significant differences between groups in 28-day mortality were observed. This adds to the growing number of convalescent plasma trials that were stopped for futility, including CONCOR-1 ( NCT04348656 ) and REMAP-CAP ( NCT02735707 ).

7 RECOVERY Collaborative Group

Convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised controlled, open-label, platform trial. 10 US Food and Drug Administration

Emergency use authorization authorizes only the use of high titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma, for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, early in the course of disease. The RECOVERY studycombines a thoughtful design with a thorough analysis in the setting of current standard practices and realistic samplings of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Primary limitations of the study include its UK only setting, poor ethnic diversity, and a long median time from symptom onset to randomisation of 9 (IQR 6–12) days. The study succeeds in capturing key features previously missed in earlier trials with convalescent plasma. Of note, the large number of study participants reassures the validity of the findings. In addition to its study size, the trial rightfully focused away from patients requiring mechanical ventilation (617 [5%] of all randomly assigned participants) who would not likely benefit from an antibody-based treatment. The enrolled participants accurately reflected international standards of care, with 10 681 (92%) patients receiving corticosteroids. After enrolment and random assignment, selected participants received two units of convalescent plasma. Each convalescent plasma unit required a sample to cutoff ratio of 6·0 or more on the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA test targeting the spike glycoprotein (PerkinElmer, London, UK). By US Food and Drug Administration standards,all of these units would be regarded as high-titre units (EUROIMMUN sample to cutoff ratio of ≥3·5; Convalescent Plasma Emergency Use Authorization Letter of Authorization March 9, 2021).

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality 28 days after randomisation, and there was no evidence that convalescent plasma provided any benefits over and above usual care. Additionally, no significant effect was observed on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days. An extensive subgroup analysis did not identify a unique cohort that would benefit from receiving convalescent plasma. Patients with shorter durations of symptoms shared similar outcomes as those later in their disease course. There was a slight rate ratio reduction of 0·90 (95% CI 0·82–0·97) for invasive mechanical ventilation or death in the study population with a negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody test; however, this reduction was not significantly different when compared with the SARS-CoV-2 antibody test positive and unknown subgroups. The data collection period occurred between May 28, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021, and the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant in late 2020 was also considered. A pre-Dec 1, 2020, versus post-Dec 1, 2020, subanalysis showed no differences to suggest that the B.1.1.7 variant disrupted the study's findings.

NIH halts trial of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in emergency department patients with mild symptoms. Despite the many challenges of doing rigorous clinical research during the COVID-19 pandemic, the RECOVERY Collaborative Group has contributed valuable conclusions against the use of convalescent plasma for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Special populations, such as patients with impaired humoral immunity, who were not actively considered in this study, might still benefit from convalescent plasma when admitted.Convalescent plasma might also find a therapeutic role in an ambulatory setting for mild-to-moderate COVID-19, as supported by Libster and colleagues;however, the clinical trial of COVID-19 convalescent plasma of outpatients (C3PO; NCT04355767 ) determined that this cohort was unlikely to benefit.Future ambulatory trials with convalescent plasma might need to be matched against monoclonal antibody therapies or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, and eligibility criteria will need to tightly define the population most likely to benefit. The amount of effort invested in each convalescent plasma transfusion, from donor to blood bank to medical team to patient, deserves an equally great amount of consideration of whether the transfusion will provide any benefit. Current and future studies are exploring the next class of COVID-19 therapeutics, including small-molecule antivirals, next-generation monoclonal and polyclonal antibody therapies, and immunomodulatory agents.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis focused on effects of JAK-inhibitors on diverse outcomes in persons with SARS-CoV-2-infection and/or COVID-19. We searched on PubMed, Web of Science and Medline with search terms using the Boolean operators including coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 AND ruxolitinib OR baricitinib OR Janus kinase OR JAK. Inclusion dates were 1st January 2020 to 6th March 2021. Two investigators independently reviewed the identified abstracts and selected articles for full reviewing. Discordances were resolved by a 3rd reviewer. Review Manager 5.4 was used for the meta-analysis and modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and Jadad scale for quality assessment. Our focus was on clinically relevant outcomes including rates of ICU admission, ARDS and invasive mechanical ventilation, interval of hospital stay, and death. We also considered relevant laboratory co-variates including blood C-reactive protein (CRP) procalcitonin concentrations, pulse oxygen saturation (SP O2 ) and Pa O2 /Fi O2.

We identified 823 articles excluding 516 duplicates. Next, we identified 96 relevant articles by reviewing the title and abstract. After further review 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included all English language clinical trials and observational dataset of JAK-inhibitors used singly or with other therapies in persons with COVID-19. We excluded reviews and case reports. Studies had to report outcomes including data of survival, ICU admission, or invasive mechanical ventilation.

Data extraction

Two authors independently reviewed identified abstracts and selected articles for full review and a third reviewer resolved discordances. For each selected article we extracted baseline and study co-variates including 1st author, publication year, country, number subjects, subject co-variates, and therapy details (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1). Outcomes measures included rates of ICU admission, ARDS and use of invasive mechanical ventilation, interval of hospitalization, and survival. We used anonymized, published data without a need of Ethics Committee approval.

The paper follows evidence published earlier this year in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology, the official publication of the European Federation of Periodontology (EFP), that patients with COVID-19 were three times more likely to experience complications if they also had gum disease.2

The authors compiled existing evidence to propose a pathway by which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted to the lungs, where it causes COVID-19 lung disease.

They suggest that the virus enters the body through the upper airways (nose and mouth), collects in the saliva in the mouth and enters dental plaque under the gums. It then crosses the gums into the blood vessels, where it travels to the arteries in the lungs - rather than travelling to the lungs via the airways. The biological basis for this route of infection is outlined. In addition, the authors put forward the idea that diseased or damaged gums could weaken the mucosal barrier in the mouth and allow the virus to more easily enter the bloodstream.

According to the paper: 'If confirmed, this hypothetical model may provide a rationale for understanding why some individuals develop COVID-19 lung disease and others do not. It would also fundamentally change the way COVID-19 is managed, providing a new line of exploration into treatments targeted at the source of the viral reservoir, the mouth'. If correct, 'simple antimicrobial oral healthcare measures could be implemented not only with the aim of reducing the risk of transmission between individuals' but also as 'a means of mitigating the risk of developing lung disease, and therefore the most severe form of the disease'.

Co-author Professor Iain Chapple of the University of Birmingham said: 'Dental plaque contains billions of microbes and needs to be removed daily. Otherwise, the gums become inflamed and small ulcers that communicate directly with the bloodstream form between the gums and teeth. These allow microbes like viruses to enter the bloodstream. The plaque under the gums forms a biofilm, which acts as a self-protective environment for many microbes to survive and prosper. Given the high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva, this blood-borne route of transfer to the lungs is highly plausible'.

Professor Nicola West, EFP secretary general, said: 'More research is needed to substantiate this theory, but in the meantime, it seems sensible to take extra care in looking after our teeth and gums, get regular check-ups and undergo treatment when needed'.

In early April, Neelika Malavige shut down her laboratory in Sri Lanka for ten days to celebrate Sinhalese New Year. Malavige, an immunologist at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in Colombo, runs the only lab in the nation that sequences SARS-CoV-2 genomes. But case counts had dipped, hotspots had started to receive vaccines, and her team needed the break.

When the researchers returned to work, however, what they found was dizzying. Of 78 samples that they sequenced from people with COVID-19 in late April, 66 contained the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant. Since 17 April, the number of new COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka — which hit 2,672 on 9 May — has been breaking records almost every day. Hospitals are filling up and Malavige is bracing for a looming wave of deaths. “The situation in Sri Lanka is looking very grim,” she says.

As India struggles under the weight of a massive surge of COVID-19, many of its neighbours in south and southeast Asia are experiencing some of their largest outbreaks yet (see ‘Asia’s growing outbreaks’). There are even surges in Bhutan, where 62% of the population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and Laos, which has previously had very few cases — although these outbreaks are small compared with those in nearby nations.

Spillover from India?

Researchers region-wide are embarking on a remarkable effort to quickly scale up their very limited sequencing capacities to identify whether India’s epidemic — fuelled by variants such as B.1.617 — is spilling over into their communities, or if their outbreaks have origins elsewhere. In some cases, they are working around the clock and with insufficient resources. Specifically, they want to know whether worrying variants are circulating, so that they can assess the risks.

“It’s important to ramp up our sequencing to make sure we detect these variants in the community as soon as possible,” says Malavige, who, from May, is doubling the average number of samples sequenced each month, to nearly 200.

“We all have the question of why is it happening? Why is this wave now? And why is it so bad?” says Senjuti Saha, a molecular geneticist at the Child Health Research Foundation in Dhaka. New cases in Bangladesh reached more than 7,000 a day in mid-April. Numbers have fallen again since then, but Saha has noticed a big increase in sequences from the country shared on online genome databases and more labs are getting involved, which she puts down to concerns over the spread of variants.

Source: Our World in Data

Identifying worrying variants will help governments to make decisions about responses and restrictions, and whether more aggressive interventions are needed, says Dibesh Karmacharya, executive director of the Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, a non-profit organization in Kathmandu that sequences SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Especially worrying is B.1.617, which was first identified in the Indian state of Maharashtra, and which the World Health Organization has said is probably highly transmissible. It is spreading fast through India and might have the ability to evade some immunity from previous infections or vaccination.

“Sequencing has always been important, but it is critical now, because we are getting to a stage where more and more new variants are cropping up,” says Gavin Smith, a viral evolutionary biologist at Duke–NUS Medical School in Singapore. “We need sequence data to see what is going on.”

Worrying variants

Sequenced samples in south and southeast Asia still represent only a small fraction of cases. But they are beginning to reveal a mixed picture of variants driving outbreaks in the region.

In Bangladesh, for example, the surge has coincided with the widespread detection of B.1.351, a variant first identified in South Africa, which has been linked to reduced effectiveness of the University of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine.

Saha first found the variant in her samples in February. In March, 28 of 36 genomes she sequenced were of B.1.351, as were more than 70% of 100 sequences shared by other groups in Bangladesh that month1. The variant has swept the country, and is especially worrying for Bangladesh, because most of the vaccines available there are Covishield, a version of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India.

The picture is different in Cambodia and Sri Lanka, where B.1.1.7 is predominant. Malavige wants to keep a close eye on its spread and evolution to see whether it develops a mutation known as E484K, which is present in some other variants and might allow it to evade immunity.

Cases in Cambodia have been rising steeply since early April. All 120 or so genomes sequenced there since then have been of B.1.1.7, says Erik Karlsson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia in Phnom Penh, who runs the only lab in the country sequencing SARS-CoV-2.

The lab has greatly increased its sequencing capacity during the pandemic, and can now process more than two dozen genomes a week, providing near real-time insights. COVID-19 has “revolutionized the way we use sequencing”, says Karlsson, who has been sleeping at the institute to continue his work since a lockdown was imposed in Phnom Penh in mid-April.

The researchers in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Cambodia say they have not yet detected B.1.617 in their communities, but it could have crept in without being detected, owing to the minimal sequencing. “We are surrounded by India, and people are coming in and out all the time,” says Saha, and fewer than 1% of confirmed cases in Bangladesh have been sequenced.

Frightening picture

To the northwest, B.1.617 has definitely made its way to Nepal, which shares an extensive, largely open border with India. Reported cases of COVID-19 have shot up since mid-April — hitting a new record of 9,317 cases on 11 May. Relative to population size, that’s more cases than in India.

In early May, Karmacharya’s team sequenced 12 samples from people recently infected in the Kathmandu valley — including himself. Eleven of the sequences were of B.1.617, and one was of B.1.1.7. The results are only a tiny snapshot of what is circulating, but are still “a little scary”, says Karmacharya, who had received one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine before getting infected and has now recovered.

But although researchers recognize that more genomic surveillance would be useful, their ambitions are limited by resources. “The main problem is a lack of funds,” says Malavige.

Karlsson points out that sequencing reagents are in high demand globally. With reduced airline activity, getting supplies to Cambodia “is a fight”.

Sequencing takes time to process, says Malavige. As a shortcut, her lab uses real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kits that can quickly detect three widely circulating variants of concern: B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. But kits that detect B.1.617 have only just been developed and they cannot identify newly emerging variants.

“We are at a critical point where we need to keep sequencing to identify anything as soon as possible,” she says. And with vaccines still in very short supply in much of the region, many people will remain at risk, say researchers.",health workers administer sars cov tests at a railway station in sri lankas

the researchers returned to work however what they found was dizzying of samples that they sequenced from people with covid in late april contained the highly transmissible b 1 variant since april the number of new covid cases in sri lanka which hit 672 on may has been breaking records almost every day hospitals are filling up and malavige is bracing for a looming wave of deaths the situation in sri lanka is looking very grim she says as india struggles under the weight of a massive surge of covid many of its neighbours in south and southeast asia are experiencing some of their largest outbreaks yet see asias growing outbreaks there are even surges in bhutan where of the population has received at least one dose of a vaccine and laos which has previously had very few cases although these outbreaks are small compared with those in nearby nations spillover from india researchers region wide are embarking on a remarkable effort to quickly scale up their very limited sequencing capacities to identify whether indias epidemic fuelled by variants such as b 617 is spilling over into their communities or if their outbreaks have origins elsewhere in some cases they are working around the clock and with insufficient resources specifically they want to know whether worrying variants are circulating so that they can assess the risks its important to ramp up our sequencing to make sure we detect these variants in the community as soon as possible says malavige who from may is doubling the average number of samples sequenced each month to nearly we all have the question of why is it happening why is this wave now and why is it so bad says senjuti saha a molecular geneticist at the child health research foundation in dhaka new cases in bangladesh reached more than 000 a day in mid april numbers have fallen again since then but saha has noticed a big increase in sequences from the country shared on online genome databases and more labs are getting involved which she puts down to concerns over the spread of variants source our world in data identifying worrying variants will help governments to make decisions about responses and restrictions and whether more aggressive interventions are needed says dibesh karmacharya executive director of the center for molecular dynamics nepal a non profit organization in kathmandu that sequences sars cov genomes especially worrying is b 617 which was first identified in the indian state of maharashtra and which the world health organization has said is probably highly transmissible it is spreading fast through india and might have the ability to evade some immunity from previous infections or vaccination sequencing has always been important but it is critical now because we are getting to a stage where more and more new variants are cropping up says gavin smith a viral evolutionary biologist at dukenus medical school in singapore we need sequence data to see what is going on worrying variants sequenced samples in south and southeast asia still represent only a small fraction of cases but they are beginning to reveal a mixed picture of variants driving outbreaks in the region in bangladesh for example the surge has coincided with the widespread detection of b 351 a variant first identified in south africa which has been linked to reduced effectiveness of the university of oxfordastrazeneca vaccine saha first found the variant in her samples in february in march of genomes she sequenced were of b 351 as were more than of sequences shared by other groups in bangladesh that month1 the variant has swept the country and is especially worrying for bangladesh because most of the vaccines available there are covishield a version of the astrazeneca vaccine produced in india the picture is different in cambodia and sri lanka where b 1 is predominant malavige wants to keep a close eye on its spread and evolution to see whether it develops a mutation known as e484k which is present in some other variants and might allow it to evade immunity cases in cambodia have been rising steeply since early april all or so genomes sequenced there since then have been of b 1 says erik karlsson a virologist at the pasteur institute of cambodia in phnom penh who runs the only lab in the country sequencing sars cov people with covid receive oxygen outside an overwhelmed hospital in kathmandu nepal credit navesh chitrakar reuters the lab has greatly increased its sequencing capacity during the pandemic and can now process more than two dozen genomes a week providing near real time insights covid has revolutionized the way we use sequencing says karlsson who has been sleeping at the institute to continue his work since a lockdown was imposed in phnom penh in mid april the researchers in bangladesh sri lanka and cambodia say they have not yet detected b 617 in their communities but it could have crept in without being detected owing to the minimal sequencing we are surrounded by india and people are coming in and out all the time says saha and fewer than of confirmed cases in bangladesh have been sequenced frightening picture to the northwest b 617 has definitely made its way to nepal which shares an extensive largely open border with india reported cases of covid have shot up since mid april hitting a new record of 317 cases on may relative to population size thats more cases than in india in early may karmacharyas team sequenced samples from people recently infected in the kathmandu valley including himself eleven of the sequences were of b 617 and one was of b 1 the results are only a tiny snapshot of what is circulating but are still a little scary says karmacharya who had received one shot of a covid vaccine before getting infected and has now recovered but although researchers recognize that more genomic surveillance would be useful their ambitions are limited by resources the main problem is a lack of funds says malavige karlsson points out that sequencing reagents are in high demand globally with reduced airline activity getting supplies to cambodia is a fight sequencing takes time to process says malavige as a shortcut her lab uses real time polymerase chain reaction pcr kits that can quickly detect three widely circulating variants of concern b 1 b 351 and p but kits that detect b 617 have only just been developed and they cannot identify newly emerging variants we are at a critical point where we need to keep sequencing to identify anything as soon as possible she says and with vaccines still in very short supply in much of the region many people will remain at risk say researchers
12,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01299-y,"Now, a study suggests that delaying the second dose of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA vaccine could boost antibody responses after the second inoculation more than threefold in those older than 801.
Many COVID-19 vaccines are given in two doses: the first initiates an immune response, and the second, ‘booster’ shot strengthens it.
But for some existing vaccines, a longer wait between first and second doses yields a stronger immune response.
On 30 December, the United Kingdom announced that it would delay the second dose by up to 12 weeks after the first.
Countries will need to consider whether the variants that are circulating in their particular region might raise infection risk after only one vaccine dose, he says.",500, A study suggests that delaying the second dose of the pfizerbiontech mrna vaccine could boost antibody responses after the second inoculation more than threefold in those older than it is the first direct study of how such a delay affects coronavirus antibody levels and could inform vaccine scheduling decisions in other countries .,,"Facing a limited vaccine supply, the United Kingdom embarked on a bold public-health experiment at the end of 2020: delaying second doses of COVID-19 vaccines in a bid to maximize the number of people who would be at least partially protected from hospitalization and death.

Now, a study suggests that delaying the second dose of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA vaccine could boost antibody responses after the second inoculation more than threefold in those older than 801.

It is the first direct study of how such a delay affects coronavirus antibody levels, and could inform vaccine scheduling decisions in other countries, the authors say. “This study further supports a growing body of evidence that the approach taken in the UK for delaying that second dose has really paid off,” Gayatri Amirthalingam, an epidemiologist at Public Health England in London and a co-author of the preprint, said during a press briefing.

Many COVID-19 vaccines are given in two doses: the first initiates an immune response, and the second, ‘booster’ shot strengthens it. Clinical trials of the three vaccines used in the United Kingdom generally featured a three- to four-week gap between doses.

But for some existing vaccines, a longer wait between first and second doses yields a stronger immune response. Delaying the COVID-19 booster shots could also expand partial immunity among a greater swathe of the population than could the shorter dosing schedule. On 30 December, the United Kingdom announced that it would delay the second dose by up to 12 weeks after the first.

To determine whether the delay paid off, Amirthalingam and her colleagues studied 175 vaccine recipients older than 80 who received their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine either 3 weeks or 11–12 weeks after the first dose. The team measured recipients’ levels of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and assessed how immune cells called T cells, which can help to maintain antibody levels over time, responded to vaccination.

Peak antibody levels were 3.5 times higher in those who waited 12 weeks for their booster shot than were those in people who waited only 3 weeks. Peak T-cell response was lower in those with the extended interval. But this did not cause antibody levels to decline more quickly over the nine weeks after the booster shot.

The results are reassuring, but are specific to the Pfizer vaccine, which is not available in many low-to-middle income countries, says Alejandro Cravioto, chair of the World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization. Countries will need to consider whether the variants that are circulating in their particular region might raise infection risk after only one vaccine dose, he says.

For the United Kingdom, extending the interval between doses was clearly the right choice, but the country’s lockdown deserves part of the credit for that success, says Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, UK. “People are theoretically vulnerable between their first and second jab,” he says. “What’s worked in the UK is maintaining restrictions at the same time as vaccinating.”",facing a limited vaccine supply the united kingdom embarked on a bold public health experiment at the end of delaying second doses of covid vaccines in a bid to maximize the number of people who would be at least partially protected from hospitalization and death now a study suggests that delaying the second dose of the pfizerbiontech mrna vaccine could boost antibody responses after the second inoculation more than threefold in those older than it is the first direct study of how such a delay affects coronavirus antibody levels and could inform vaccine scheduling decisions in other countries the authors say this study further supports a growing body of evidence that the approach taken in the uk for delaying that second dose has really paid off gayatri amirthalingam an epidemiologist at public health england in london and a co author of the preprint said during a press briefing many covid vaccines are given in two doses the first initiates an immune response and the second booster shot strengthens it clinical trials of the three vaccines used in the united kingdom generally featured a three to four week gap between doses but for some existing vaccines a longer wait between first and second doses yields a stronger immune response delaying the covid booster shots could also expand partial immunity among a greater swathe of the population than could the shorter dosing schedule on december the united kingdom announced that it would delay the second dose by up to weeks after the first to determine whether the delay paid off amirthalingam and her colleagues studied vaccine recipients older than who received their second dose of the pfizer vaccine either weeks or weeks after the first dose the team measured recipients levels of antibodies against the sars cov spike protein and assessed how immune cells called t cells which can help to maintain antibody levels over time responded to vaccination peak antibody levels were 5 times higher in those who waited weeks for their booster shot than were those in people who waited only weeks peak t cell response was lower in those with the extended interval but this did not cause antibody levels to decline more quickly over the nine weeks after the booster shot the results are reassuring but are specific to the pfizer vaccine which is not available in many low to middle income countries says alejandro cravioto chair of the world health organizations strategic advisory group of experts on immunization countries will need to consider whether the variants that are circulating in their particular region might raise infection risk after only one vaccine dose he says for the united kingdom extending the interval between doses was clearly the right choice but the countrys lockdown deserves part of the credit for that success says stephen griffin a virologist at the university of leeds uk people are theoretically vulnerable between their first and second jab he says whats worked in the uk is maintaining restrictions at the same time as vaccinating

In this study we find that the presence of having an abnormal elevation of AST, ALT or ALP during admission increases the odds of admission to the ICU, and thus having more severe disease. Additionally, there was evidence of hepatocellular injury and cholestasis, with an increase in AST and ALP during admission that was worse in patients admitted to the ICU. Elevations in AST and ALT in Covid-19 have been reported by many groups1,4,5,8 with AST abnormalities found to be more frequent than ALT abnormalities. It is possible that the presence of underlying co-morbidities such as hepatitis, pre-existing liver disease such as Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) or alcoholic liver disease predispose patients to develop more severe disease; however, we found no difference in BMI comparing severe (needing ICU admission) vs non-severe disease (no ICU admission), and there were relatively few patients with Hepatitis B or C infection, underlying liver disease or who reported alcohol use in this study. Additionally, given the recent isolation of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from human liver samples3, it is probable that this virus infects liver tissue. Thus, it appears possible that SARS-CoV-2 can cause viral hepatitis and that this infection can increase disease severity, especially given the association of these markers with the need for ICU admission found in this study. It should be noted that ALT is known to be a more specific marker of hepatocyte injury relative to AST, which is found in many other tissues9; thus it is possible that these elevations represent other manifestations of systemic illness. Future studies should examine the incidence of outcomes such as acute liver failure, in Covid-19 patients to understand the relationship between transaminase elevation and clinical outcomes in Covid-19.

Regarding cholestatic liver function, it is not surprising that peak ALP was found to be higher in patients admitted to the ICU and that there was a non-significant trend towards a greater frequency of TB and INR abnormalities in those who died. It is known that cholestatic function can be compromised in critical illness, which can manifest as elevations in ALP and TB10,11. Although we did not examine patients for causes of cholestasis in this study, future projects should further characterize these cholestasis abnormalities seen in more severely ill Covid-19 patients.

There may be evidence of mild pancreatic injury in patients with severe covid-19 illness12. We did not find any differences in lipase based on ICU admission; furthermore, we found only one patient who had a lipase above the ULN and this data point was < 2X the ULN. Indeed, our sample size was small (N = 21), and neither amylase nor CT-imaging findings were analyzed in this study. However, in line with a recently published study13, this data suggests pancreatic injury is not occurring in Covid-19 illness.

We additionally find here that patients with hypoalbuminemia have a higher mortality rate and an association with hypotension in hospitalized patients. Similar findings have already been published by multiple groups14, however, most of this data has been studied in the Chinese population. In the USA, it appears that patients of minority backgrounds are disproportionately affected by this illness, and studies to date may not have fully captured this population15. Eighty six percent of patients included in this study were of minority background; thus, it appears that the association of hypoalbuminemia and mortality is consistent across multiple populations. Regarding hypotension, albumin has long been known to be the primary driver of oncotic pressure in vascular tissue and hypoalbuminemia is known to cause fluid extravasation and edema; thus, the finding of an association here between hypoalbuminemia and hypotension is not surprising. Future studies should address the influence of ethnicity and background to determine if there are prognostic factors in Covid-19 unique to distinct populations.

The strengths of this study include a focus on minority populations and reliance on objective, easily obtained, biochemical markers to define prognosis in Covid-19. Limitations include a smaller relative sample size, focus on one hospital system and reliance on patient self-report for some data points. Additionally, no data was collected on treatment or use of medications like acetaminophen, which may cause elevated transaminases.

Patients with hematologic malignancy [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20], particularly those with CLL [21,22,23], are of interest given prior reports suggesting poor outcomes following diagnosis of COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with CLL experience suboptimal vaccine efficacy, especially those receiving CLL-directed therapy [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. For example, a recent report by Pleyer, et al. demonstrated a 4% response rate to the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in patients treated with BTK inhibitors versus a 28% response rate in treatment-naïve patients. In that same report, 42% of BTK inhibitor treated patients and 59% of treatment-naïve patients mounted a response to the recombinant herpes zoster vaccine. Collectively, these data suggest that BTK inhibitors profoundly impact response to vaccines for pathogens in which pre-existing immunity is not present.

In this study, we found that only half of vaccinated patients with CLL develop detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 antibodies. Furthermore, we found a significant difference between rates of detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 antibodies between treatment-naïve patients (17/18, 94%) and those who had received CLL directed therapy (6/26, 23%). These striking findings suggest that vaccination in patients with CLL may not confer the efficacy that we expect in the general population, particularly in patients receiving CLL-directed therapy.

These data support conducting prospective clinical studies of vaccine efficacy in patients with CLL and other immunocompromising conditions. While we await establishment of herd immunity, specific guidance for patients with CLL are warranted as the current Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations regarding relaxed personal protective equipment use when around other vaccinated people may not apply to this population [24].

Of a total of 479 patients, 344 patients (172 pairs before and during the pandemic) were identified in the statistical matching process as suitable for inclusion. The matched groups did not differ in their matching variables before and during the pandemic, including ADL and chronic disease. By comparing these data, we found that there were no significant differences in age, gender, marital status, educational level, or monthly income between the two periods. These demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Comparisons of PCS and MCS by demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with stroke (n = 344). Full size table

The mean age of the participants was 61.57 ± 12.67 years, and 64.83% (N = 223) of the participants were male. Most participants were married (N = 314, 91.28%). The education level of 52.62% of the respondents was high school or higher, and that of 47.38% was junior high school or lower. In total, 37.79% of participants had monthly incomes of less than 3000 RMB, 48.26% had monthly incomes of 3001–6000 RMB, and 13.95% had monthly incomes of more than 6000 RMB. Most participants had three or more chronic diseases (N = 236, 68.60%). The mean ADL score of the participants was 24.10 ± 13.98. Approximately 29.07% of participants had intracerebral hemorrhage (N = 50) and 70.93% had cerebral infarction (N = 122). Most participants had hemiplegia (N = 163, 94.77%), while a few of them had aphasia (N = 44, 25.59%) or dysphagia (N = 6, 3.49%).

Comparisons of stroke patients’ QOL and QPR scores

Comparisons of PCS and MCS based on demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. Participants older than 60 years with a lower educational level, lower monthly incomes, higher disability, intracerebral hemorrhage, hemiplegia, aphasia or dysphagia were found to have lower PCS or MCS. There were no significant differences in PCS and MCS relating to gender, marital status, and chronic conditions.

Comparisons of PCS and MCS before and during the COVID-19 pandemic are shown in Fig. 1. Before the pandemic, the mean PCS and MCS values among the patients with stroke were 37.98 ± 14.52 and 43.50 ± 20.94, respectively. During the pandemic, these scores were 44.20 ± 18.92 and 54.24 ± 19.08. The overall PCS and MCS and the PF, RP, GH, RE, SF, VT sub-scores were significantly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic.

Comparisons of PCS and MCS considering thoughts about the pandemic are shown in Table 2. For each item, scores > 3 were used as grouping criteria for pandemic stress. During the pandemic, more than half of the participants felt that the impacts of the pandemic on their daily life were very low, low, or medium (N = 100, 58.14%), and less than half of them felt that the impacts were high or very high (N = 72, 41.86%). Most of the participants felt that the risk of infection was very low, low, or medium (N = 123, 71.51%), and few of them felt that the risk was high or very high (N = 49, 28.49%). Most of the participants felt that their worries about the pandemic were very low, low, or medium (N = 126, 73.26%), and few of them felt that their worries were high or very high (N = 46, 26.74%). The comparisons showed that participants with lower pandemic stress had a significantly higher PCS and/or MCS.

The mean QPR score of the participants was 56.74 ± 13.26 (Table 2). Patients had higher QPR scores during the pandemic (59.04 ± 11.95) than before the pandemic (54.45 ± 14.11). During the pandemic, those who felt that their worries about the pandemic were high or very high had lower QPR scores.

Associated factors of QOL

In the Spearman correlation analysis (Table 3), the QPR was positively associated with PCS (p < 0.001), MCS (p < 0.001), and the eight concepts of QOL (p < 0.001).

Table 3 Variables of the study during the pandemic (n = 172). Full size table

For the PCS, we carried out a three-step HMR (Table 4). In the first step, the demographic and clinical characteristics were in the model. Adjusted R2 was 0.474, which accounted for 83.8% (0.474/0.568) of the model. When pandemic stress was added in the model, adjusted R2 was 0.557. The change of R2 was 0.083, which meant that 14.6% (0.083/0.568) of PCS could be caused by pandemic stress in the model. In the third step of HMR, QPR was entered in the model. Adjusted R2 was 0.568 and ΔR2 was 0.011, which meant that 1.9% (0.011/0.568) of PCS could be explained by the QPR in this model. Among all variables measured in this study, PCS was significantly associated with, in the sequence of β value, ADL (β = − 0.587, p = 0.001), felt that the “impacts of the pandemic on daily life were high or very high” (β = − 0.231, p = 0.001), chronic disease (β = − 0.131, p = 0.018), QPR (β = 0.129, p = 0.024) and age (β = − 0.113, p = 0.045) (Fig. 2).

The study variables of PCS are shown in the forest plot. Age, chronic disease, ADL, felt that the “impacts of pandemic on daily life were high or very high” were negatively associated with PCS, while QPR was positively associated with PCS.

For the three-step MCS regression model (Table 4), the demographic and clinical characteristics was added in the model for the first step. Adjusted R2 was 0.066, which meant that 17.9% of MCS could be explained by the variables of demographic and clinical characteristics in the model. In the second step of HMR, pandemic stress was added in the model. Adjusted R2 was 0.303, The change of R2 was 0.237, which meant that 64.2% of MCS could be explained by the new added variables of pandemic stress in the model. In the third step of HMR, QPR was new added in the model. Adjusted R2 was 0.369 and ΔR2 was 0.066, which meant that 17.9% of MCS could be explained by QPR in the model. Among all variables measured in this study, MCS was significantly associated with, in the sequence of β value, felt that the “impacts of the pandemic on daily life were high or very high” (β = − 0.353, p = 0.001), QPR (β = 0.284, p = 0.001), felt that the “risks of contracting the COVID-19 were high or very high” (β = − 0.208, p = 0.006), stroke type (β = − 0.159, p = 0.036), age (β = − 0.141, p = 0.037) and dysphagia (β = − 0.138, p = 0.037) (Fig. 3).

The study variables of MCS are shown in the forest plot. Age, stroke type, dysphagia, felt that the “impacts of pandemic on daily life were high or very high”, felt that the “risks of contracting the COVID-19 were high or very high” were negatively associated with PCS, while QPR was positively associated with PCS.

In summary, stroke patients’ basic characteristics (age, chronic disease, stoke type, dysphagia, ADL), pandemic stress and QPR were variables associated with PCS and MCS during the pandemic (Table 4 and Fig. 4).

This nationwide retrospective cohort study identified the risk factors of mortality and fatal adverse outcomes among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Korea. In particular, dementia, ICU admission, age ≥ 60 years, malignancy, and dyspnoea, were associated with higher odds of mortality. In addition, BMI 18.5–22.9 or 23.0–24.9, and higher levels of lymphocytes or platelets, were associated with lower odds of poor clinical outcomes.

The present study showed that older age (≥ 60 years) was associated with mortality and fatal adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Although individuals > 65 years comprise 17% of the total population in the United States, they account for 31% of COVID-19 patients, 45% of hospitalized patients, 53% of those on intensive care unit admission, and 80% of those that died due to COVID-1914. This suggests that older individuals are susceptible to developing COVID-19 and have poor clinical outcomes compared with the general population. Our results showed that individuals ≥ 60 accounted for 32% of COVID-19 and 92% of deaths due to COVID-19. In accordance with our study, recent studies reported that older age is significantly associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients9,10.

Previous studies reported that male sex is significantly associated with mortality9,15. Our data showed that although mortality was significantly higher in male patients than in female patients in the Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis, male sex was not a significant risk factor for mortality in the Cox proportional hazards model. We recommend a larger worldwide cohort study to explore this discrepancy between our results and those of previous studies.

The risk of serious disease and mortality in COVID-19 increases with the presence of comorbidities16,17,18,19,20. Our data showed malignancy as an independent risk factor for mortality in the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.054. According to a recent study from China, cancer patients with COVID-19 had 3.5 times higher risk of requiring ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, compared to the general population21. Cancer patients are generally immunocompromised and are at higher risk of COVID-19-related fatal events in comparison to the cancer-free population21,22.

Our study also showed that dementia was associated with mortality and fatal adverse outcomes. Some reasons can be proposed to explain our results. First, most of the patients suffering dementia are old and have other comorbidities that could result in poor clinical outcomes23. Second, people with dementia would require the support of dementia caregivers in order to keep preventive and healthcare measures. However, this COVID-19 pandemic has made the availability of caregivers limited24. Third, persistent inflammatory state of dementia patients may increase peripheral blood white blood cells and neutrophil counts, which was associated with higher mortality from COVID-1925. Fourth, the ApoE e4 genotype, which were associated with patients with dementia26, can increase the risk of having acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Similar to our data, a previous study reported that mortality due to COVID-19 was significantly higher in elderly patients with dementia27. Another study reported an in-hospital mortality of 61% among hospitalized patients with dementia and COVID-1928. In our study, mortality during the isolation period was 33.5% among patients with COVID-19. Two large cohort studies from the United Kingdom showed that pre-existing dementia was a significant predictor of COVID-19 mortality11,20. Furthermore, a recent study, including global big data on dementia and COVID-19 in 185 countries revealed a significant correlation between dementia burden and COVID-19-related death29.

In the present study, although diabetes mellitus (DM) was not a predictor of mortality in the Cox proportional hazards model, it was associated with mortality and fatal adverse outcomes in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Some case series reported that patients with pre-existing DM are vulnerable to infection and are at a higher risk of death from COVID-195,15,30,31,32. According to a recent meta-analysis, diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality as well as severity of COVID-19, as compared to those in non-diabetics33. Similar to the prior meta-analysis, our results showed that DM was associated with increased odds of mortality of 2.728 and fatal adverse outcomes of 1.838 in multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Our study demonstrated that dyspnoea and ICU admission were associated with mortality and fatal adverse outcomes in both the multivariable logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. Data from urban communities in the United States revealed that patients admitted to the ICU had a higher incidence of respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality compared with patients in the general ward9. Another study showed that dyspnoea at presentation was associated with hospitalization and the need for ICU management9. According to a recent meta-analysis, dyspnoea was the only symptom predictive of severe COVID-19 and ICU admission19. Similar to the previous meta-analysis, our study showed that dyspnoea was the only symptom predictive of fatal adverse outcomes.

A recent study using a systemic review and meta-analysis showed that hematologic and inflammatory markers such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase and decreased albumin could help predict severe outcomes in COVID-1934. Our study showed that lower levels of lymphocytes or platelets were associated with increasing hazards of mortality and fatal adverse outcomes. COVID-19 patients with low levels of lymphocyte and platelets should be monitored closely to minimize the risk of progression to severe disease.

The present study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective nature of the study design and data extraction procedure, some laboratory data were missing or unavailable. Therefore, their influence might have been underestimated in predicting mortality and fatal adverse outcomes. Second, our data did not include information regarding radiologic findings, which might reveal prognostic factors35. Third, although treatment strategy can have a significant impact on clinical outcome36,37,38, we assumed that enrolled patients all had adequate and timely management. Fourth, although our study included over 5600 patients with COVID-19 from Korea, there was a lack of time-series analysis for potential variables. Fifth, by excluding patients still under isolation as of April 30, 2020, the case fatality ratio in our data could not reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. Sixth, our study did not include data regarding the status of therapy for each comorbidity. For instance, metformin use was associated with reduced mortality39, but statin use was not40.",to our knowledge this is one of the largest nationwide cohort studies in covid patients with definite

A proportion of patients with COVID-19 will require hospitalization for severe respiratory illness that may potentially lead to life-threatening hypoxic respiratory failure.

In patients with COVID-19, hypoxic respiratory failure is associated with systemic inflammation, and treatment with inflammation-lowering corticosteroids has been shown to improve outcomes. Therefore, it is conceivable that other inflammation-lowering agents could also prove beneficial; one such agent is tocilizumab, an antibody that blocks inflammatory IL-6 signaling.

The ongoing RECOVERY trial is investigating several potential treatments for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients in the UK. As part of this study, the researchers recruited over 4,000 hospitalized patients with hypoxia and markers of systemic inflammation and treated them with standard-of-care therapy, with or without tocilizumab. They found that within 28 days, patients treated with tocilizumab had lower rates of mortality, were less likely to require mechanical ventilation, and were more likely to be discharged from hospital.

These data support the use of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

The World Health Organization (WHO) was too cautious in communicating the risks of COVID-19 early last year, according to the first major investigation of the global pandemic response. Had it been bolder, and had nations heeded its guidance, the pandemic might have been curtailed, say the authors of the report.

Last year, during the annual World Health Assembly, countries demanded that the WHO initiate an independent review of how the COVID-19 crisis unfolded, so it could draw lessons for the future. The resulting report, released on 12 May, was assembled by a panel of 13 global-health experts partly appointed by, but independent from, the WHO.

The lengthy investigation identifies February 2020 as the month when — in a parallel universe — the devastating toll of the pandemic might have been lessened, had countries acted fast to limit the spread of the virus. It goes on to list concrete actions that could help to prevent a similar fate should another pathogen with pandemic potential emerge, and it lays out a plan for how vaccines can reach low- and middle-income countries as soon as possible, to end the current crisis. “The reality is, we are still in the thick of this,” explains panel member Joanne Liu, a health-emergency specialist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

Some researchers say that the panel’s suggestions for how to strengthen the WHO are too vague. But the panel does make a few ambitious recommendations, including creating a council of world leaders dedicated to fighting pandemics, says Stephen Morrison, director of global health policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. “They are trying to grab a moment that everyone knows will pass pretty fast,” says Morrison.

A bolder WHO

The WHO sounded its highest alarm, declaring the outbreak a ‘public health emergency of international concern’, or PHEIC, on 30 January 2020. It should have done so about a week earlier, the independent panel concluded in a preliminary report. But in its final summary of the investigation, the panel places more emphasis on what happened between that alarm and when the WHO called the crisis a pandemic on 11 March. Unlike in December 2019 and January 2020, by February, the danger of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spreading globally was well known, and its toll might have been curtailed by national containment strategies. “It is glaringly obvious that February 2020 was a lost month,” the report says.

A handful of Asian countries made rapid moves in February last year to curb COVID-19, including instituting comprehensive testing for SARS-CoV-2 and tracking people who tested positive. “But the rest of the world sat on their hands,” says Liu. She and her colleagues assessed how the WHO communicated risk in February 2020, and decided that the agency’s cautious weighing of incomplete evidence might help to account for why many countries failed to take action.

“When it became obvious that the countries that were wearing masks were faring better than the ones that weren’t,” she says, “the WHO might have said that even though we don’t have all of the data, we should apply the precautionary principle,” and recommend masks. Similarly, the report indicates that governments might have taken the danger of SARS-CoV-2 more seriously had the WHO described the epidemic as a pandemic sooner, even though the term is not defined in the agency’s protocols for handling health emergencies.

Just after the report was published, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced that he would review the investigation’s critiques and proposals, along with those of two other reports expected in the coming weeks, and would discuss reforms with all countries comprising the WHO.

Global-health experts have long worried that the WHO faces severe limitations in triggering action. It has no legal power to enforce recommendations and demand information. And it struggles to criticize governments’ actions, because it is chronically underfunded and reliant on donations from its member countries and territories. So the panel recommends a higher budget for the agency, and says that every country with an epidemic must permit WHO officials to access outbreak locations on short notice — a swipe at the weeks of negotiation required for the first WHO visit to Wuhan, China (where the first cases of COVID-19 were reported), in February 2020.

Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says these changes would be fine, but they don’t fully address problems mentioned in the report. For instance, countries would need to agree to reform the regulations dictating the WHO’s protocols so that it has the authority to declare a pandemic. Currently, it can only declare a PHEIC. Nuzzo says: “The WHO is only what we deem it to be.”

Preventing future pandemics

Among the report’s stronger recommendations is the formation of an organization outside the WHO — a Global Health Threats Council — that would hold countries accountable for curbing pandemics. The council would include the presidents and prime ministers of several high-, middle- and low-income countries, and its role would be to admonish governments if they fail to prepare for, or respond to, health emergencies, on the basis of advice from scientific agencies. It could be especially powerful if it’s enacted along with a proposed pandemic treaty that is currently being pushed by European countries, in which governments would pledge to strengthen their responses. “Not a bad idea,” says Morrison, “but I don’t know if any of this is feasible in our deeply divided, nationalist world.”

For such a council to exist, a diverse and large number of governments would need to lobby the United Nations to adopt it. But Morrison says that nations that tend to be cagey with information are unlikely to back a group designed to pressure them into transparency. Nonetheless, Liu says, the panel is aiming high, to match the stakes of preventing another crisis of this scale. “By 2025, we are expecting US$22 trillion in losses,” she says. “This pandemic has paralysed the planet for 18 months — when was the last time that happened?”

Liu and her colleagues will present the recommendations to world leaders at the Global Health Summit in Rome next week, and at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, in late May. They want to find countries willing to take the ideas forward so that they can become policy.",more than 000 people in brazil have died of covid since the beginning of the pandemic credit michael dantas afp via getty the world health organization who was too cautious in communicating the risks of covid early last year according to the first major investigation of the global pandemic response had it been bolder and had nations heeded its guidance the pandemic might have been curtailed say the authors of the report last year during the annual world health assembly countries demanded that the who initiate an independent review of how the covid crisis unfolded so it could draw lessons for the future the resulting report released on may was assembled by a panel of global health experts partly appointed by but independent from the who the lengthy investigation identifies february as the month when in a parallel universe the devastating toll of the pandemic might have been lessened had countries acted fast to limit the spread of the virus it goes on to list concrete actions that could help to prevent a similar fate should another pathogen with pandemic potential emerge and it lays out a plan for how vaccines can reach low and middle income countries as soon as possible to end the current crisis the reality is we are still in the thick of this explains panel member joanne
